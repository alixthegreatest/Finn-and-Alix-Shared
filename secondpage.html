Discord Username ~ alixthegreat#2760

Date of the last time you applied for staff? (If not applicable put N/A)~ N/A

Timezone and Country? ~ Great Britain GMT

Date of birth, Age? ~ 17/05/2005

Do you have access to Discord, and a working microphone? ~ Yes

Do you have the ability to record? ~ Yes

Do you have a screenshotting software such as Gyazo or Lightshot? ~ I have Gyazo installed but i have very little knowledge as to how to use the application. I am able to watch tutorials on learning the application however.

Why do you want to be helper on PVPWars? ~ I very much enjoy playing on the server, i think that the current staff team are very genuine nice people. I have enjoyed every moment of playing on this server and i believe that it is a truly great server. I would love to be a helper as i think that i would be a great example, i would enjoy having a bit of authority and being able to manage the server. At times i have found certain people to be unruly and with an extra member of staff on the team i believe that it may help to decrease these occurences.

What do you believe that you can contribute to the network? ~ I have some knowledge of moderating minecraft servers and i am able to use my iniative and common sense in order to solve certain problems. I am able to cope well under stress and i will be able to bring a sense of welcomeness to new users or those in need. EDIT : I have knowledge of commands and a good idea of minecraft which i believe will help me to help new players to settle into a new server as well as checking up on those more experienced players who may have any queries. I feel as though this is a good concept as it may prevent new players from leaving shortly if they are unable to understand the servers concepts. As a player myself i think that it is very important for a server to engage you quickly and have a staff team available for you to dive into the gameplay which on certain servers it can be hard for them to grasp. One idea of this may be Skyblock Ice in which the economy is very high meaning that an new players interested in starting may not be able to keep up with the demand for money on this server.

What helps to keep you most motivated within a staff team? ~ To me, the idea of being part of a team helps me to stay motivated as it would make me feel more relaxed knowing that if things escalate i have someone to ask for help and that other people are going through the same problems as me.

Why should we choose you over others applicants? ~ I believe that due to my kindness and empathetic mind set i am able to connect with members of the server in order for them to convey any problems to me. Not only in terms of gameplay but i would be able to help a player who may be having a rough time in other instances such as personal life. Despite this however, i would not let this get in the way of my job and i would keep very personal things out of the way .

How active can you be on the server? (Estimate Schedule on a Weekly Basis) ~ I can put in a minimum of 20+ hours a week, i am unaware of whether or no this is a high number or not but i have school for the majority of the time so this would be evenings and weekends.
EDIT:
Monday 7PM - 10PM
Tuesday 4PM - 10PM
Wednesday 8PM - 10PM
Thursday 7PM - 10PM
Friday 7:30PM - 12PM
Saturday 7+ Hours , May Vary
Sunday 7+ Hours , May Vary


Have you had any previous experience in any type of moderation? If So, Explain. ~ I was a staff member for an upcoming server, the server did release and i was an admin for a week or so before the server met an unexpected end due to the owners unforeseen personal problems. I would have small tasks such as explaining basic concepts to new players and managing factors such as the chat, keeping it clean. EDIT : My role would often depend on the servers player count, if the minecraft server didnt have any players on or very few then i would arrange roles with the other staff members. This would mean that one of us would be in charge of keeping control over the few players online or we may have a role such as managing the discord, engaging in conversation with the players on discord but not on the server. Another role we may have had would have been advertising, at the time the server was small so one of our main goals was to engage players within the server and trying to bring new players into the server. We would often advertise on the minecraft forums or partner with other minecraft servers via discord. I believe i may be an important asset for the staff team in terms of server management, managing the chat and helping out new players. At times where i may be unavailable to help out in terms of the minecraft server, i would more than happily engage myself in the discord, talking to the community and answering any questions.

If you were in a situation where you weren't sure what to do, how would you handle it as a helper? ~ I would use my iniative in order to think about the situation and any strategies to manage it. If the situation became too much i would reflect on any staff guides before contacting any other online members of staff. I would not go straight to another member of staff as i would think for myself before this.

Minecraft Experience/knowledge? (Years) ~ I have had the game since 17th May 2014. (5+ years)

Do you fully understand the concept to our Network? If so, could you be able to provide players with useful information when required?(as well as typical Minecraft knowledge)? ~ I have a basic idea of the servers concepts however i would not like to let this be a barrier as i am committed and if needed i would happily read up on any guides. I do have a good understanding of minecraft however and feel as though this may help.

Does this application meet the 800 word minimum requirement? (https://wordcounter.net/) ~ Yes this is around 810 words.

Please provide a screenshot of your global timeplayed. You can get this ingame by doing /gtimeplayed. ~ [â€‹IMG]


Anything else you would like us to know. If so, Say it here! ~ If possible, would you be able to send me a log or some form of text document informing me on server rules with their according punishments and a guide on the servers concepts which may become necessary?
