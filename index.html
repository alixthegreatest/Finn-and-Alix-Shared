<H3><UL><B>Hello, I am interested in joining the web-design industry, <br>
my dad had a bet with my brother that if he could make a <br>
website he would get a new PC, after he failed attempting <br>
to do this, I decided that i would take upon the challenge, <br>
so far, it hasn't been too difficult, however, I have not <br>
added images or Hyperlinks.</B></UL></H3></p>
<UL><B>I've linked my instagram below, if you get a chance, please <br>
feel free to follow me, on there iI mainly post my skate videos <br>
though I'm thinking of opening up a youtube account dedicated to <br>
computing related videos, among the countless others out there.</B></UL> </div>

<H3><UL><B>Thanks for visiting my webpage, this is obviously my first one, 
but I'm a GCSE Computing student so hopefully, i should have this
whole thng figured out by then. Enjoy the Hymn I wrote earlier
 I wore my Christmas tie to church today.</B><UL></H3></section>

<H3><UL>It’s an innocuous little black number with miniature Santas all over it, but it was more than enough to embarrass my ten-year-old daughter, who prematurely entered a teenage state of mind a decade or so early.

“It’s not even December yet!” she huffed. “Why do you have to be such a geek?”

“’Tis the season to be jolly!” I geeked back. “Don we now our gay apparel!”

“It’s gay, all right,” she said. (I walked right into that one.)</UL></H3>

<section class="poem"><UL><B>Here is a poem I wrote too</B></UL>

<H3><UL>1

After the beautiful boy killed himself I killed myself <br>
and lived in the trash vortex, the j’accuse of the US <br>
with gear and the beclouded night kindness and a mind <br>
like a mule deer in the poorest of zips. My affection <br>
got only so close before I withdrew into self-protection, <br>
my white tail an insolent so long. I lived by borrowing <br>
the stillness and dominion and circumference and how dare <br>
be anything at all, mud under his boot sole, the roux <br>
of the cookbooks he borrowed from the library, <br>
and I returned and wanted stew and the simmering of him. <br>

Where was the equipment for living? Where was the witness? <br>
And where was the Very Rich Hours: the exchange of rings, <br>
the gathering of flowers? Both beautiful and boy and April <br>
gone the way of trumpeting May and ghost structures <br>
of the Gothic, costly blue and gold depicting <br>
Could you say beautiful and boy after the beautiful boy <br>
killed himself? April felt like retrograde February, <br>
impoverished color fields of angry, blowing on our hands <br>
in the Middle Ages of Syracuse where we lived in a university <br>
city, joining faith to magical thinking to tactics for fleeing. <br>

After the beautiful boy killed himself was <br>
became impossible to hold in one mind, my mind, <br>
and I could not look directly at is, the wind <br>
and the thinly branched sapling that is/was his height <br>
and others wore shoes like his shoes, like <br>
was legal and the swellings of April illegal <br>
made up as it was [was] of gaps and lapses. <br>
I depended on the vertical hell of other people <br>
for story, for a narrative however broken, <br>
a tolerance that could be that charmed or bitter, <br>
could be what takes the place of nouns and verbs. <br>

After the beautiful boy killed himself I was a mackle <br>
of presence, a blurred capital letter that marked <br>
a person’s breathing, while he was immaculately <br>
gone except for all the damage to our throats <br>
and to our umbilical selves. Touch was too much <br>
or not enough. White space was obliterated by April’s <br>
mute riot or was it organized into caravans stopped ... <br>
Ah, what luxury to have his crossed letters on paper, <br>
rationed wartime material we have now in abundance, <br>
and map what we know in scratches and around that what? <br>

Cuts, knots, rips, fissures, dots, the ink drips <br>
from the person after the beautiful boy killed himself, <br>
stopgap concept, the grief counselor kept it together <br>
or at arm’s length so the ________ can’t find the ________. <br>
I asked her for experience and I got a view from above— <br>
grace, I’ll take it, the casserole, the pepper pot; <br>
I’ll take the fix, the unopened bills for the services <br>
rendered, the renderings billed. Any fix is myopic, <br>
like a mother’s look at the child’s flaws as virtues, <br>
as self-incrimination, the crime being the rich <br>
attachments of subjects, objects, finishes. <br>

6 <br>

Clouds blocked the sun all April <br>
after the beautiful boy killed himself, <br>
blocked by the body and the next steps, blocked <br>
the pronouns, blocked and, blocked then, <br>
although, before, so after the beautiful boy <br>
we loved the jagged now for its promise and threat, <br>
for its torn map of Detroit and its alternate plans <br>
of duration and what was it yesterday I said <br>
after the beautiful boy killed himself about stopping <br>
me while I was weeping to say ghost = get = go on. <br>

7 <br>

What energies and economies of the daily, <br>
the obvious snows and obliteration and shoveling <br>
disrupted when the beautiful boy killed himself? <br>
He keeps moving down or is it up? Is there up <br>
in the pedestrian advance to the drugstore for more <br>
pain medication, buying a coffee to go and a doughnut? <br>
Why not start from the start, from the hesitant <br>
and make a progress that’s disrupted by the end, <br>
disrupted by the currency? Are you paying for what <br>
you break or the opposite? How do you intend to pay? <br>

Come back, come back—we’re asking the highest power <br>
of corporate capital to make you vertical once more <br>
without metaphor—the corporeal you. We will assign the pronoun <br>
by shareholders and trustees who will agree to your exceptional <br>
growth potential, no, growth imperative, to the cult of you <br>
and the evangelism of the ask. We burn, we spread like disease <br>
but the brutal agglomeration of you we love, we pull you up <br>
by your bootstraps, we trade in the sublime machine for you. <br>
We will endure you as you did not endure the terrible world, <br>
I thought after the beautiful boy killed himself.</UL></H3></section>
